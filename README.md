### [Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming/avoid-mutations-and-side-effects-using-functional-programming)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
Fill in the code for the function `incrementer` so it returns the value of the global variable `fixedValue` increased by one. `fixedValue`should not change, no matter how many times the function `incrementer` is called.

## HINTS
### Hint 1:
Using the incrementer operator (`++`) on `fixedValue` will mutate `fixedValue`, meaning it will no longer reference the same value it was assigned with.
